### Conway's Game of Life
*Conway's Game of Life* is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician **John Horton Conway** in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, and requires no further input after the initial setup. The game takes place on a grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two possible states: alive or dead.

**The rules for the evolution of the Game of Life are straightforward:**

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies as if caused by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
